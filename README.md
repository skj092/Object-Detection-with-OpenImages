# Object-Detection-with-OpenImages

Objective: - Object Detection with OpenImages
Open Images is a new dataset first released in 2016 that contains ~9 million
images – which is fewer than ImageNet. What makes it stand out is that these
images are mostly of complex scenes that span thousands of classes of objects.
Moreover, ~2 million of these images are hand-annotated with bounding boxes
making Open Images by far the largest existing dataset with object location
annotations. In this subset of images, there are ~15.4 million bounding boxes
of 600 classes of object.
Dataset Link: - Dataset is pretty big. SO we do not want to train it completely.
So please extract any 10 classes images and annotations that you like. Then
train it.

Task: - Create a Web Application using Flask. Use the end user should be able
to upload an image and get results with the prediction score. Use any CNN
architecture launched after 2017.

Deployment: - Any Free Platform(Try to look out for free options.)


* Step1: Downloading the dataset ( https://github.com/cvdfoundation/open-images-dataset )
* step2: Download the annotation (https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download_v4.html)
